# Sprint 01 – Python Basics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the TripleTen Data Analytics Post Graduation (Sprint 01).  
The main goal was to practice **basic Python programming**, focusing on **data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis** of a small e-commerce dataset.

The tasks included string manipulation, working with lists and numbers, implementing loops and conditionals, and calculating basic metrics from user data.

## 📝 Project Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed unnecessary spaces and replaced underscores in user names.  
2. **String Manipulation** – Split full names into first and last names.  
3. **Type Conversion** – Converted user age to integer and handled invalid entries.  
4. **List Manipulation** – Converted all favorite categories to lowercase.  
5. **Basic Metrics** – Calculated total, minimum, and maximum spending per user.  
6. **Loops & Conditionals** – Implemented a `while` loop to simulate additional purchases until a spending target is reached.  
7. **String Formatting** – Created formatted summary strings for users.  
8. **Nested Lists** – Worked with nested lists representing multiple users.  
9. **Filtering & Aggregation** – Filtered users by age and spending thresholds.  
10. **Combining Multiple Filters** – Identified users who match multiple criteria.  
11. **Data Summaries** – Extracted names and ages for users with specific purchase categories.
