# Sprint 04 - Megaline Telecom Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the TripleTen Data Analytics Post Graduation (Sprint 04).  
The goal was to analyze the revenue generated by two prepaid plans (Surf and Ultimate) offered by Megaline Telecom. The analysis aimed to determine which plan generates more revenue and understand user behavior across calls, messages, and internet usage.

The tasks included data loading, cleaning, transformation, aggregation, visualization, and statistical hypothesis testing.

## 🎯 Objective
Determine which prepaid plan generates higher revenue based on user consumption data and examine whether revenue differs by geographic location (NY-NJ vs other regions).

## 📂 Dataset
**Files:**  
- `/datasets/megaline_calls.csv`  
- `/datasets/megaline_internet.csv`  
- `/datasets/megaline_messages.csv`  
- `/datasets/megaline_plans.csv`  
- `/datasets/megaline_users.csv`  

**Columns:** Vary per dataset, e.g.,  
- `calls.csv`: `id`, `user_id`, `call_date`, `duration`  
- `internet.csv`: `id`, `user_id`, `session_date`, `mb_used`  
- `messages.csv`: `id`, `user_id`, `message_date`  
- `plans.csv`: `plan_name`, `usd_monthly_pay`, `minutes_included`, `usd_per_minute`, `messages_included`, `usd_per_message`, `mb_per_month_included`, `usd_per_gb`  
- `users.csv`: `user_id`, `city`, `reg_date`, `plan_name`, `churn_date`

## 📝 Steps

1. **Data Loading & Libraries**  
   - Loaded all datasets into separate DataFrames.  
   - Imported Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy.stats`, `datetime`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Converted date columns to `datetime`.  
   - Renamed `plan` column in `users.csv` to `plan_name` for consistency.  
   - Created new columns: month, duration rounded up (`ceil`) for calls, internet usage in GB.  

3. **Data Aggregation**  
   - Calculated monthly metrics per user: total calls, total minutes, total messages, total internet usage.  
   - Merged user consumption with plan details to compute overage charges.  
   - Calculated total monthly charge per user considering plan inclusions and extra usage.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized consumption trends by plan and month using bar plots and boxplots:  
     - Calls: average duration and total minutes.  
     - Messages: total messages sent.  
     - Internet: GB used.  
   - Observed behavioral differences between Surf and Ultimate plan users across the months.

5. **Revenue Analysis**  
   - Calculated revenue per plan per month.  
   - Visualized revenue distribution with bar plots and boxplots.  
   - Observed that Ultimate plan has higher average monthly revenue, while Surf plan has higher variance and outliers.

6. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**  
   - **Test 1:** Compare mean revenue between Surf and Ultimate plans.  
     - Null hypothesis: mean revenues are equal.  
     - Result: rejected null hypothesis → revenue means are different.  
   - **Test 2:** Compare mean revenue for NY-NJ users vs other regions.  
     - Null hypothesis: mean revenues are equal.  
     - Result: rejected null hypothesis → revenues differ by region.

## 📊 Results
- Ultimate plan generates higher average revenue monthly.  
- Surf plan shows higher variance and occasional outlier revenues due to over-usage.  
- User behavior differs by plan and month for calls, messages, and internet usage.  
- Revenue differs significantly between NY-NJ users and users in other regions.

## 🏁 Conclusion
- The Ultimate plan generates higher average revenue and is more stable in user charges.  
- Surf plan users can generate higher revenues when exceeding plan limits.  
- Regional differences (NY-NJ vs other regions) affect revenue.  
- Statistical tests confirm that revenue differences between plans and regions are significant (α = 0.05).
